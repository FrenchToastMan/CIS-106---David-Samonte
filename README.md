# CIS-106---David-Samonte
I'm currently taking this course because it is one of the recommended classes that my counselor has chosen according to my IT tech support path. I think this class is also a good step into the coding field and will help me see if I want to pursue more coding in the future. Coding has always interested me especially because I play video games a lot and I've always wondered how the developers implemented certain mechanics in their game. I understand that this is a beginning course in programming so we won't be developing games here but I still think I can learn alot from this class.
